#### Why Do I Want This?

In 2012, the American Medical Association's Council on Science and Public Health [made this recommendation(http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/csaph/a12-csaph4-lightpollution-summary.pdf):

"Recognizes that exposure to excessive light at night, including extended use of various electronic media, can disrupt sleep or exacerbate sleep disorders, especially in children and adolescents. This effect can be minimized by using dim red lighting in the nighttime bedroom environment."

Ever since installing F.lux on my computer, no matter how late into the night I work, once I leave my computer I have no trouble falling asleep.

**Important Mac Preference Update**

Because F.lux runs as a process, in order to use this workflow, youâ€™ll need to allow Alfred to "control your computer" by going to: System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Accessibility, and selecting Alfred 2.
